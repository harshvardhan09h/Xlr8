## What makes our bot different
We tried our best to make our bot different not only in mechanical but also in electrical part.
   #### Mechcanical
   We used aluminium Chasis to build our bot. First we cut our Chasis into 2 parts from middle and then we joined the 2 parts using springs. WE used 3 springs, One in middle(size=5) and two on edges(size=4).
   This provided our bot a good suspension which helped us in completing the track.
   #### Electrical
   We used components Arduino UNO,bluetooth Module and a Motor Driver. we tried to use ESP 32 but it was not working and when we ask for replacement it was too late, we went for Arduino UNO.
   not only this we coded for it ourselves and we put special function in it and they were working very nicely. we put 45 degree turn at a time,Tackle move (which helped us in dropping the blocks),
   , Different shapes that our bot can make like-Square,pentagon, Heart shape,Eight Shape.
   
   All these things makes our Bot Diffrent from others.
   ## Motivation For the Idea
   we get the idea for our Bot from our mentor.Not only The mentor alloted but also other mentors. We aslo saw some Previous Year Xlr8 Videos from Youtube.
   All thses things motivated us For our bot design.
   ## Resources Used
   Arduino UNO,Blurtooth Module, Motor Driver
   ## Help from our Mentor
   At last moment he helped us in rectifying our only functional circuit , having lost all our electric components (being short circuited) , he helped us with the Arduino UNO and Bluetooth module based circuit and made our bot functioning.
He was  very approachable and very willing to make us learn coding rather than just copying the general one.
